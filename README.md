This project is meant to show off my skills as a potential website developer.
First we learned the basics, such as proper syntax, html declaration, and creating a head, body and footer, creating the base for our website. Then we learned the different kinds of headings, using paragraphs, creating sections, and creating lists, which we used in our bio and hobbies section. Next, we learned how to add links, such as linking websites or referencing images or fonts, we used this to link an image of ourselves in our hero and adding picture to our gallery. To give everything a pop, we began adding style sheets. It started with coloring text and backgrounds such as in our hero, gallery, and footer, and then applying all these colors in our CSS stylesheet. We gave elements sizes, adding fonts, aligning elements, and adding padding and margins, such as in our blog section. The next important things we learned were flex and grid: flex directions, flex wrap, flex row, grid columns, and grid rows -- we used this to have our gallery and captions either be next to each other or below one another. We learned to attach an iframe to include a video below our blog. Lastly, we added a contact form with selectable options, different inputs, a send button, and a place for these submissions to go. 

The color scheme I chose was based off of my preference for the "dark mode" versions of websites, as well as adding some of my favorite colors. The background was set to #1D1C20, which was black but not too dark, and our text color was #F5F5F5, which was white but not too light. Other elements were given a red option of either #FF4545 or #973336, or a light purple #515EC3, to have a brighter pop of color. 

For my gallery, I decided to put examples of my own artwork, both to help the audience learn some things about me, and because I could feature artwork without having to credit another artist. My avatar is sourced from the free avatar generator, https://getavataaars.com/. My logo, though it belongs to a fictional corporation, was created by game company Capcom. 

In my blog article, I used https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_animations.asp and https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_animations/Using_CSS_animations as sources for my research on CSS animations. 

I am reserving the copyright to my own artwork.
