How big are the monitors in this room? I own a 24 inch monitor myself and I was thinking of upgrading to a bigger size. I assume these are 27 inch 1440p monitors, but they could even be 4K since the text looks really crisp. Unfortunately I can't check because the monitor where I sit has no keyboard or mouse plugged into it. I wish they made 25-26 inch 1440p OLED monitors with good text clarity. That's what I would want, personally. I like my monitor, it's 24 inch 1440p (wow)! But it's stuck at 60hz...
