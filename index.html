            <p> Hi! I'm Sal. No, it's not short for anything. </p>
            <p> It took me until my third year in college until I gained a sense of what I wanted to accomplish with a college degree. I have had a list of several hobbies from drawing, writing, gaming, video editing, roleplaying, collecting several things, and most recently, building PCs. But it wasn't until last year or so I figured "I would actually really enjoy working with computer hardware and software for years to come." </p>
            <p> I have always had an affinity for computers for as long as I can remember. One of my earliest memories is sitting with all my preschool friends gathered around the family computer as I typed away the most ridiculous thing I could find on YouTube. Or having a video call with my grandparents who lived in the "far away United States" on Windows Live Messenger, choosing to communicate through the keyboard instead of using the microphone. While that was impressive for a four year old back in 2008, it is now rather common to see young children with supercomputers in their hands. Yet, having worked in childcare, I still saw kids older than I was at the time struggling to figure out how to right-click. It's become so easy to use a phone or tablet that Gen Alpha did not become the tech-savvy successors to Gen Z. A shame, I must say. </p> 
        <p>In the sixth grade I took a STEM class that had us code very basic things into scratch. It was so basic, in fact, that I had the free time to code a barebones version of a PS1 fighting game. Psh, no biggie. It's still receiving attention on scratch since I first posted it in 2016. The coding is rough, but to be fair, I did it all on my own. Clearly, that class was NOT on my level. </p>
    <p>Now I'm 20, and while I might still be the family tech support guy, I figured I can get a little more out of my niche. That's how I got here. </p>

                <p>"And now we must settle what we do. We have here much data, and we must proceed to lay out our
                    campaign. We know from the inquiry of Jonathan that from the castle to Whitby came fifty boxes of
                    earth, all of which were delivered at Carfax; we also know that at least some of these boxes have
                    been removed. It seems to me, that our first step should be to ascertain whether all the rest remain
                    in the house beyond that wall where we look to-day; or whether any more have been removed. If the
                    latter, we must trace----"</p>

                <p>Here we were interrupted in a very startling way. Outside the house came the sound of a pistol-shot;
                    the glass of the window was shattered with a bullet, which, ricochetting from the top of the
                    embrasure, struck the far wall of the room. I am afraid I am at heart a coward, for I shrieked out.
                    The men all jumped to their feet; Lord Godalming flew over to the window and threw up the sash. As
                    he did so we heard Mr. Morris's voice without:--</p>

                <p>"Sorry! I fear I have alarmed you. I shall come in and tell you about it." A minute later he came in
                    and said:--</p>

                <p>"It was an idiotic thing of me to do, and I ask your pardon, Mrs. Harker, most sincerely; I fear I
                    must have frightened you terribly. But the fact is that whilst the Professor was talking there came
                    a big bat and sat on the window-sill. I have got such a horror of the damned brutes from recent
                    events that I cannot stand them, and I went out to have a shot, as I have been doing of late of
                    evenings, whenever I have seen one. You used to laugh at me for it then, Art."</p>

                <p>"Did you hit it?" asked Dr. Van Helsing.</p>

                <p>"I don't know; I fancy not, for it flew away into the wood." Without saying any more he took his
                    seat, and the Professor began to resume his statement:--</p>
