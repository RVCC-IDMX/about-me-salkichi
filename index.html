                How big are the monitors in this room? I own a 24 inch monitor myself and I was thinking of upgrading to
                a bigger size. I assume these are 27 inch 1440p monitors, but they could even be 4K since the text looks
                really crisp. Unfortunately I can't check because the monitor where I sit has no keyboard or mouse
                plugged into it. I wish they made 25-26 inch 1440p OLED monitors with good text clarity. That's what I
                would want, personally. I like my monitor, it's 24 inch 1440p (wow)! But it's stuck at 60hz...

                <p>"And now we must settle what we do. We have here much data, and we must proceed to lay out our
                    campaign. We know from the inquiry of Jonathan that from the castle to Whitby came fifty boxes of
                    earth, all of which were delivered at Carfax; we also know that at least some of these boxes have
                    been removed. It seems to me, that our first step should be to ascertain whether all the rest remain
                    in the house beyond that wall where we look to-day; or whether any more have been removed. If the
                    latter, we must trace----"</p>

                <p>Here we were interrupted in a very startling way. Outside the house came the sound of a pistol-shot;
                    the glass of the window was shattered with a bullet, which, ricochetting from the top of the
                    embrasure, struck the far wall of the room. I am afraid I am at heart a coward, for I shrieked out.
                    The men all jumped to their feet; Lord Godalming flew over to the window and threw up the sash. As
                    he did so we heard Mr. Morris's voice without:--</p>

                <p>"Sorry! I fear I have alarmed you. I shall come in and tell you about it." A minute later he came in
                    and said:--</p>

                <p>"It was an idiotic thing of me to do, and I ask your pardon, Mrs. Harker, most sincerely; I fear I
                    must have frightened you terribly. But the fact is that whilst the Professor was talking there came
                    a big bat and sat on the window-sill. I have got such a horror of the damned brutes from recent
                    events that I cannot stand them, and I went out to have a shot, as I have been doing of late of
                    evenings, whenever I have seen one. You used to laugh at me for it then, Art."</p>

                <p>"Did you hit it?" asked Dr. Van Helsing.</p>

                <p>"I don't know; I fancy not, for it flew away into the wood." Without saying any more he took his
                    seat, and the Professor began to resume his statement:--</p>
