            <p> Hi! I'm Sal. No, it's not short for anything. </p>
            <p> It took me until my third year in college until I gained a sense of what I wanted to accomplish with a college degree. I have had a list of several hobbies from drawing, writing, gaming, video editing, roleplaying, collecting several things, and most recently, building PCs. But it wasn't until last year or so I figured "I would actually really enjoy working with computer hardware and software for years to come." </p>
            <p> I have always had an affinity for computers for as long as I can remember. One of my earliest memories is sitting with all my preschool friends gathered around the family computer as I typed away the most ridiculous thing I could find on YouTube. Or having a video call with my grandparents who lived in the "far away United States" on Windows Live Messenger, choosing to communicate through the keyboard instead of using the microphone. While that was impressive for a four year old back in 2008, it is now rather common to see young children with supercomputers in their hands. Yet, having worked in childcare, I still saw kids older than I was at the time struggling to figure out how to right-click. It's become so easy to use a phone or tablet that Gen Alpha did not become the tech-savvy successors to Gen Z. A shame, I must say. </p> 
        <p>In the sixth grade I took a STEM class that had us code very basic things into scratch. It was so basic, in fact, that I had the free time to code a barebones version of a PS1 fighting game (which you can find <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/112295075/#comments-437371672" target="_blank">here</a>). Psh, no biggie. It's still receiving attention on scratch since I first posted it in 2016. The coding is rough, but to be fair, I did it all on my own. Clearly, that class was NOT on my level. </p>
    <p>Now I'm 20, and while I might still be the family tech support guy, I figured I can get a little more out of my niche. That's how I got here. </p>

            <div>
                <p>CSS allows us to animate elements in HTML without the need for JavaScript. These animations allow an element to to gradually change style from one state to another. Before we can use animations, though, we will have to specify some keyframes for the animation. Keyframes tell us how an element will be styled at a certain point in time. CSS styles must be specified inside the @keyframes rule. Here, the animation will change from its current style to the new style. The animation should be given a name and bound to an element. Then, a duration must be specified, since the default is 0s. 
                </p>

                <p>To specify when the style will change, we can use the keywords "from" and "to" or use percentages to add as many style changes as we need. For example, an element could change when the animation is 25% complete, 50% complete, and then again when it is 100% complete. We can also delay animations before starting, as well as use negative delay values as if the animation had been playing for a specified amount of time. Additionally, we can set how many times an animation will play. We can play it once before it stops, or we could play it infinitely if we wanted to, as well as anything in between.  </p>

                <p>There is also a direction in which to run the animation: it is forward by default, but can be played in reverse, go forwards and backwards, or go backwards and forwards. A speed curve can be applied to an animation as well. It can be linear, meaning having the same speed start to end, it can ease in or out by having a slow start, slow end, or both, or you can even define your own values. Another important thing to know is the fill-mode for an animation. CSS animations do not affect an element before the first or after the last keyframe is played. We can override this by using the animation-fill-mode property. </p>

                <p>By default, an animation will not apply any styles to the element before or after the one it is executing. The forwards value has an element retain the style values set by the final keyframe (dependent on the animation direction). The backwards value makes an element have the style values set by the first keyframe (once again, dependent on the animation direction). Both as a value is also possible, in which the properties are extended in both directions. Lastly, we can use the animation property as shorthand for properties such as animation-name, animation-duration, animation-delay, and so on. </p>
